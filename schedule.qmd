# Overview

The Statistical Computing Workshop (formerly R Workshop) is a year-long series that meets three times per quarter during the academic year. The purpose of the workshop is to learn, practice, and update cutting edge statistical programming skills as they apply to quantitative and computational social science. 

Workshop meetings will feature internal or external speakers introducing a new tool, method, approach, or practice. All meetings are hybrid or fully virtual.

The workshop is open to everyone, but those formally enrolled will receive full credits by attending to every meeting. To receive credit, you must sign up to the corresponding version of POLI_SCI 490 in the **Spring** quarter. You can only get credit for the workshop once.

The aim is to present topics that are equally useful for new and advanced users. So if you see a topic that you are already confident on, chances are that you will still learn something new. The open-ended coding sessions are also a good instance to learn some intangible skills.
