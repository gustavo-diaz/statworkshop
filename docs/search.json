Vector Data: Represents geographic features as points, lines, or polygons.\nExamples:\n- Points: Locations of schools, stores, or crime incidents\n- Lines: Roads, rivers, or flight paths\n- Polygons: State boundaries, land parcels, Census tracts\n\nRaster Data: Represents spatial data as a grid of pixels, commonly used for continuous data like elevation, temperature, and satellite imagery.\n\nExample: A satellite image of land cover, where each pixel represents vegetation, water, or urban areas."

    "text": "What is tidycensus?\nThe tidycensus package is an R interface to the U.S. Census Bureau API. It is useful for mapping, analyzing, and visualizing demographic data in R.\nIt allows users to retrieve demographic and socioeconomic data from:\n\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) (yearly estimates)\nThe Decennial Census (10-year population counts)\nOther Census datasets\n\nHere are a few of the commands you can use to access Census Bureau products:\n\nget_acs(), which requests data from the 1-year and 5-year American Community Survey samples. Data are available from the 1-year ACS back to 2005 and the 5-year ACS back to 2005-2009.\nget_estimates(), an interface to the Population Estimates APIs. These datasets include yearly estimates of population characteristics by state, county, and metropolitan area, along with components of change demographic estimates like births, deaths, and migration rates.\nget_flows(), an interface to the ACS Migration Flows APIs. Includes information on in- and out-flows from various geographies for the 5-year ACS samples, enabling origin-destination analyses.\nget_pums(), which accesses data from the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample APIs. These samples include anonymized individual-level records from the ACS organized by household and are highly useful for many different social science analyses.1"

The purpose of the workshop is to learn, practice, and update cutting edge statistical programming skills as they apply to quantitative and computational social science.\nWorkshop meetings will feature internal or external speakers introducing a new tool, method, approach, or practice. All meetings are hybrid or fully virtual.\nThe workshop is open to everyone, but those formally enrolled will receive full credits by attending to every meeting. To receive credit, you must sign up to the corresponding version of POLI_SCI 490 in the Spring quarter.\nContact Gustavo Diaz for additional information."
